# Database-management-system-in-C
Database management system build using regular expression in C.This DBMS will perform basic Sql queries like create, insert, select, update and many more which can be used in analysing the different datasets. This System is developed purely in C and can be updated further for more features.

*INTRODUCTION
2.5 quintillion bytes of data created everyday. Database management system manipulates data itself, data format etc. Meant to handle large collection of data Management of data involves Defining structures for storage of information Providing mechanisms that can do the manipulation of stored information. Current research is to study and develop algorithm that can access the file system through SQL commands using C language.

*ABSTRACT
Technology solution used to optimize and manage the storage and retrieval of data. Provides a systematic approach to manage databases via an interface for users. Accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data.

*OBJECTIVE
To design an interface for user interaction with the system. Implementation of selected DDL, DML and DQL of the SQL queries to implement and design a SQL complier. CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, DROP  Design and implement data structure for file data, update and retrieval.
